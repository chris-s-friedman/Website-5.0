                <h1>The Dragon: Drexel’s Undergraduate Research Journal is proud to
announce the inaugural call for papers for the fall 2015 volume. </h1>

<p>
    This new journal’s mission is to showcase
the research of Drexel undergraduates
across all disciplines. As the only peerreviewed
journal of undergraduate
research at Drexel, the Dragon introduces
students to the scholarly publication and
review process. The Dragon also serves as
a venue for the sharing of knowledge at
Drexel, allowing students an opportunity
to communicate with other
undergraduates with an interest in
research so that they may develop the
skills related to the production of
knowledge and gain a greater
understanding of the world outside of
their fields of study. The Dragon is an
online, annual publication of research
performed by Drexel undergraduate
students. The Dragon is a publication of
the Drexel Undergraduate Research
Council, a student organization whose
goal is to increase access to research
opportunities at Drexel.
