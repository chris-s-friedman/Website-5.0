    		Currently I am a member of the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/johnkounios/laboratory"> Creativity Research Lab, </a> whose focus lies in problem solving, insight, creativity, and cognitive style.
    		There, much of the work I do supports EEG research conducted in the lab.
    		I am also a member of the <a href = "http://www.drexel.edu/psychology/research/labs/nezuchpr/"> Nezu Stress and Coping Laboratory </a> whose research and program development efforts involve developing and evaluating interventions to attenuate the negative effects of life stress on people's health and mental health. 
    		There, I am involved in studies evaluating the efficacy of problem solving therapy as an intervention strategy for patients with heart failure and a similiar study involving patients with high blood pressure. 
    		I also assist on a study looking at the relationships among models of problem solving. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    		My first research experience was in the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, working with <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p1970224"> Dr. Oksana A. Jackson. </a>
    		There I assisted studies examining the psychological and surgical outcomes of children with speech deficits due to cleft lip and palate, as well as with children with breast and chest deformities. 
    		Additionally, I assisted on a 3-D imaging study to assist in diagnostic procedures relating to children with facial palsy. I also assisted on data analysis procedures for multiple studies. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    		My personal research interests lie in cognition, creativity, neuroscience, and the role and impact that technology plays in our lives.
    		An interesting take on this area of research was conducted by Manoush Zomorodi and her staff at WNYC's radio show, Note to Self, during the <a href = "http://www.wnyc.org/series/bored-and-brilliant/"> Bored and Brilliant series, </a> a week of challenges and activities meant to get listeners to rethink their relationships with their technology and to get just a bit more creative.
