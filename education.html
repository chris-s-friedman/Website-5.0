        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I've spent a couple of intense years studying at Drexel. So what have I actually been studying?</p>
      </div>
    </div> 
    
    	<!-- Here's the main body text-->    
    	<div class = "container">
    		<p> My studies in psychology have shown me things that I never before had imagined developing an interest in. 
    		One of the first aspects of psychology that I grew a special interest in is cognitive neuroscience, which I was introduced to by a special topics course on the subject. 
    		I grew an enthusiasm for the subject in further advanced classes on memory, learning, and the physiological basis of psychology. 
    		The other subject wich I had not expected to become so enthused about is statistics. 
    		Through statistics courses in psychology and courses on research in psychology, I have learned to genuinely enjoy the role that stats play the psychological sciences. 
    		This enthusiasm has further motivated me to learn more about stats and the programs used within statistics. 
    		In addition to SPSS, I have learned how to use R. 
    		For simple statistics, I like to use the new program called <a href = " https://jasp-stats.org/ "> JASP </a> an open-source alternative to SPSS. </p>
    		<p> In addition to my studies in psychology I am also pursuing minors in philosophy and in biology. 
    		My education in biology is a general one, that I have chosen so that I may have a better understanding of the human body and how it affects behavior. 
    		I have had the luck to be able to tailor my education in philosophy to those areas of the subject in which I am most interested. 
    		In addition to the basic courses on western philosophy and ethics, I have taken courses in logic and on the semiotician, pragmaticist, and logician of science (among many other things), C. S. Peirce. 
    		Currently, I am pursuing an independent study in neuroethics. 
    		My goal is to round out my philosophy education with advanced courses on philosophy of mind. </p>
    		<p> My expected graduation is in December of 2016.</p>
